# Morloc Meetup #1: Practical Morloc in the Shell
Aug 12, 2025

## Meetup focus: practical use of Morloc in CLI tooling

### Basic plan
 
 * Meet for four weeks in this series (may start new series afterwards)

**Tentative schedule:**

 * (Week 1) Build light-weight, composable CLI tools

 * (Week 2) Configure and specialize tools

 * (Week 3) Fancy data: binary, tables, matrices, and tensors

 * (Week 4) Morloc as a workflow language (job submission, caching etc)

## Meetup focus: practical use of Morloc in CLI tooling

### Your roles

 * ask questions and be helpfully critical
 * be patient (Morloc is in beta, there are lots of sharp edges)
 * let me know if you find bugs, including:
   * unexpected behavior (normal bugs)
   * poorly documented features
   * bad error messages
   * anything that is more harder than it ought to be 
 * share your work

---

## Today's agenda

 * Install Morloc with the new `morloc-manager` script
   * See manual info: https://morloc-project.github.io/docs/#_installing_morloc
 * Explore two simple CLI tools
 * Compose them together to make one tool
 * In the following weeks we'll build on this tool
